# Spotify Music Player!

The Spotify Music Finder! was developed using Java, JavaFX, as well as GSON and JSON libraries. The platform enables users to explore and discover music from Spotify's vast database, facilitating easy searches for tracks, albums, and artists.

## Project Overview

The Spotify Music Finder! is a Java-based application that leverages JavaFX, GSON, and JSON libraries to create a user-friendly platform for exploring and discovering music from Spotify's vast database. Users can perform searches for tracks, albums, and artists, with the application dynamically retrieving and displaying relevant information using Spotify's API. The project's graphical user interface, powered by JavaFX, enhances the overall user experience with seamless navigation and visually appealing design elements. Efficient data interchange is achieved through the use of JSON, and the GSON library plays a key role in parsing and handling JSON data, streamlining integration with Spotify's API. This independent project, not affiliated with Spotify, is created for educational and non-commercial purposes. Credits are given to the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) for making the project possible.
